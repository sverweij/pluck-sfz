- Or listen to the demo sounds [on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/sander-verweij-471550965/sets/pluck-sample-instrument-demo)



## Background
This is my 'hello world' for creating a sampler instrument with sfz.

The samples come from the _Pluck_ plugin that ships with Audacity. This reduces some of the complexity that typically comes with building a sampler instrument so I could focus on learning sfz and general software sampler concepts; There is no need to denoise, tune, shift, normalize or edit the sample, as the source already noiseless, in tune, normalized etc. 

### Samples
Exported as ogg vorbis from Audicity. Wihtin Audacity generated with the _Pluck_ plugin:
- attack samples: 4 seconds, fadeout gradual
- release sample: 0.125s, fadeout gradual
